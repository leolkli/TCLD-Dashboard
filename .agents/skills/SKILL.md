# Building AI Agent / Workflow

## Critical Instructions

- **Interpret Intent**: Accurately capture user intent. Execute specific capabilities or multiple as needed. Ask if unclear.
- **SDK Usage**: Use **Microsoft Agent Framework** exclusively. DO NOT apply if user *explicitly* asks for other SDKs/packages.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Agent Creation**: Generate AI agent code with best practices
2. **Existing Agent Enhancement**: Update, fix, add features, add debug support
3. **Model Selection**: Recommend and compare AI models
4. **Tracing**: Integrate tracing for debugging and monitoring
5. **Evaluation**: Assess agent performance and quality
6. **Deployment**: Go production via deploying to Foundry

## Core Principles

- **Language**: Use **Python** as the default programming language if unspecified.
- **Microsoft Agent Framework**: Unified Python/.NET SDK for enterprise AI agents and workflows with type safety, checkpointing, and multi-agent orchestration.
- **Python Environment**: For new projects, always create and use a workspace-local virtual environment. For existing projects, detect and respect the project's existing Python environment.

## Toolbelt

## Agent Creation

**When to use**: User asks to "create", "scaffold", "start", "build" a new agent or workflow.

### 1. SDK Setup

**Python**: Requires Python 3.10 or higher. Pin version (==1.0.0b260107) to avoid breaking changes like `AgentRunResponseUpdate`/`AgentResponseUpdate`, `create_agent`/`as_agent`, etc.

```bash
# for reference, should use virtual environment if existing
pip install agent-framework-azure-ai==1.0.0b260107 agent-framework-core==1.0.0b260107
```

**.NET**: Use `--prerelease`. Remind user in generated documentation.

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.AzureAI --prerelease
dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI --prerelease
dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.Workflows --prerelease
# or use version "*-*" for the latest version
```

### 2. Options & Alternatives

- **More Samples**: If the scenario is specific, call `githubRepo` to search for more samples before generating.
- **Minimal / Test Only**: If user requests "minimal" or "test-only" code, skip Agent-as-Server, Debug, and verification steps.
- **Deferred Config**: If user *explicitly* wants to configure later, skip **Model Selection** and remind them to update `.env` later. Still create the `.env` file with placeholder values.

### 3. Creation Workflow

Use following checklist to track progress:

```markdown
Creation Progress:
- [ ] Gather context (Samples, Model, Server, Debug)
- [ ] Create implementation plan
- [ ] Select model & configure environment
- [ ] Implement code (Agent-as-Server pattern)
- [ ] Install dependencies
- [ ] Verify startup (Run-Fix loop)
- [ ] Documentation & Handoff
```

**Step 1: Gather context**

Call tools from the **Toolbelt**. For standard new agent requests:

**Required tools**:
- `aitk-get_agent_model_code_sample` - can call multiple times for different intents
- `aitk-agent_as_server` and `aitk-add_agent_debug` - for production and debug patterns
- `aitk-get_ai_model_guidance` - for model selection
- `aitk-list_foundry_models` - get user's available Foundry project and models

**Recommended tools**:
- `githubRepo` - search for advanced patterns: MCP, Multimodal, Assistants API, Responses API, Copilot Studio, Anthropic, Reflection, Switch-Case, Fan-out/Fan-in, Loop, Human-in-Loop

**Step 2: Create implementation plan**

Before coding, think through a detailed step-by-step implementation plan. Output the plan (high-level steps avoiding redundant details) so user can know what you will do.

**Step 3: Select model & configure environment**

*Decide on the model BEFORE coding to ensure correct client/credential patterns.*

If user has not specified a model, transition to **Model Selection** capability.

**ALWAYS create/update the `.env` file** with the required variables, ensuring not to overwrite existing variables. The values depend on whether configuration is deferred:
- **Standard flow** (model specified or selected via Model Selection): populate with real values.
- **Deferred Config** (user *explicitly* wants to configure later): populate with placeholder values and remind the user to update them before running.
  ```
  FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=<project-endpoint>
  FOUNDRY_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<model-deployment-name>
  ```
- Always output what's configured, location, and how to change later if needed

**Step 4: Implement code**

- **Server Mode**: Must implement Agent-as-Server pattern (HTTP) unless "Minimal" requested.
- **Debug**: Apply dev tools and add `.vscode/launch.json` and `.vscode/tasks.json` (from `aitk-add_agent_debug`).
- **Patterns**: Use context from gather step to structure the agent or workflow.

**Step 5: Install dependencies**

1. Generate/update `requirements.txt`.
2. Use workspace-local virtual environment or create one via `configurePythonEnvironment`. For new projects, always create new virtual environment.
3. Verify Python environment using `getPythonExecutableCommand`. Do NOT proceed if it resolves to global/system Python.
4. Install packages using `installPythonPackage` or terminal command with the verified venv executable.

**Step 6: Verify startup (Run-Fix loop)**

Enter a run-fix loop: run → [if unexpected error] fix → rerun → repeat until no startup/init error.

1. Use `getPythonExecutableCommand` to get the correct Python command. Never invoke bare `python` or `python3`.
2. Run the main entrypoint (HTTP Server).
3. **If startup fails**: Fix error → Rerun.
4. **If startup succeeds**: Stop server immediately.

**Guardrails**:
- **DO** perform a real run to catch startup errors early (static syntax check is NOT enough)
- **DO** cleanup after verification. If you started the HTTP server, you MUST stop it
- **DO** ignore environment/auth/connection/timeout errors. Focus ONLY on startup/init errors
- **DON'T** wait for user input
- **DON'T** create separate test code or scripts
- **DON'T** mock configuration

**Step 7: Documentation & Handoff**

- Create/Update `README.md`.
- Remind user next steps for production-readiness:
  - Debug / F5 can help user quickly try / verify the app locally
  - Tracing setup can help monitor and troubleshoot runtime issues

## Existing Agent Enhancement

**When to use**: User asks to "update", "fix", "add feature", "enhance", or "improve" an existing agent.

**Principles** (for Microsoft Agent Framework; DO NOT change other SDKs unless explicitly asked):

1. **Context First**: Before changes, explore codebase to understand existing architecture, patterns, and dependencies.
2. **Explore & Gather**: Use **Toolbelt** to gather context while respecting existing types.
3. **Respect Tech Stack**: Do NOT migrate or change other SDKs unless explicitly requested.
4. **Respect Existing Types**: Keep existing types like `*Client`, `*Credential`, etc. No migration unless explicitly requested.
5. **New Features**: Follow **Creation Workflow** principles (Server mode, Debug support).
6. **Respect Existing Environment**: Detect and use existing Python environment via `getPythonExecutableCommand`. Never override or migrate an existing environment unless explicitly requested.
7. **Debug Support Addition**: Add debugging support with AI Toolkit Agent Inspector. Follow Step 6 (Verify) for correctness.
8. **Verify**: Use Step 6 from Creation Workflow to ensure no regressions.

## Specialized Capabilities

### Model Selection

**When to use**: User asks to "configure", "change", or "recommend" a model, or asks "which model" to use. Also triggered automatically during Agent Creation.

**What to do**: Use `aitk-get_ai_model_guidance` and `aitk-list_foundry_models`.
- Need to get both project endpoint and model deployment name for further configuration.
- For production-quality agents/workflows, recommend Foundry model(s).

**Important considerations**:
- User's existing model deployment is a quick start, but NOT necessarily the best choice. Recommend based on user intent and model capabilities.
- Always output clear explanation of your recommendation and show alternatives even if not deployed.
- If no Foundry project/model is available, recommend creating one via Foundry extension.

### Tracing

**When to use**: User asks to "monitor", "trace", or improve "observability".

**What to do**: Use `aitk-get_tracing_code_gen_best_practices` to retrieve best practices, then apply them to instrument the code.

### Evaluation

**When to use**: User asks to "improve performance", "measure", or "evaluate" the agent.

**What to do**:
- **Planning First**: Use `aitk-evaluation_planner` to clarify metrics, test dataset, and runtime.
- **Runner**: Use `aitk-evaluation_agent_runner_best_practices` for collecting responses from test datasets.
- **Code**: Use `aitk-get_evaluation_code_gen_best_practices` for evaluation code generation.

### Deployment

**When to use**: User asks to "deploy", "publish", or "go production" the agent.

**What to do**:
1. Ensure the app is wrapped as HTTP server (if not, use `aitk-agent_as_server` first).
2. Execute VS Code command: [Microsoft Foundry: Deploy Hosted Agent](azure-ai-foundry.commandPalette.deployWorkflow).
